<p>As I was learning R, I had the opportunity to co-teach a day-long class on the subject with <a href="https://twitter.com/holomarked">Mark Edmondson</a>. He was <em>wildly</em> more skilled with the language and convinced me that my relative newness would help me clearly communicate and teach the basics to a small group of digital analysts.</p>
<p>Mark had the idea (I didnâ€™t even know it was possible) to use <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown</a> to create a site that could be both the in-class content (augmented by lecture, live demos, and in-class exercises), as well as a post-class reference that could also be used by other analysts who were looking to learn R (and, ideally, some foundational statistical concepts and methods).</p>
<p>We later expanded that 1-day training to be a 3-day training that we conducted in the U.S., which gave us the opportunity to refresh and expand the site.</p>
<p>Since then, our maintenance has been pretty sporadic, but we continue to get feedback that it is a useful resource.</p>
