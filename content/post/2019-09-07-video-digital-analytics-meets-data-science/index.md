As I continued my exploration of R and statistics, I got interested in figuring out what I could do with "standard" digital analytics data. That resulted in this presentation at [Superweek](https://superweek.hu) in 2019 that included three examples, all of which were accompanied by Shiny apps that participants could use to explore their own Google Analytics data:

* **"Time-normalizing" of web traffic**--a straight-up munging of the traffic of a filtered set of web pages (such as blog posts) so that their launch dates were individually transformed to a "time zero"
* **Exploration of On-Site Search**--demonstrating some basic text analysis, including unnesting of phrases, stemming, and LDA
* **Linear Regression with Categorical Variables**--really, an explanation of how categorical/nominal variables get hot-encoded to dummy variables, and then how to interpret the results of a linear regression
