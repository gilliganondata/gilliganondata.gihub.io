This was as much an opportunity to fiddle around with:

* Using RMarkdown to generate slides (this was before I discovered xaringan)
* Using [ari](http://seankross.com/2017/09/25/Create-Videos-from-R-Markdown-Documents-with-Ari.html) to generate a video from slides
* Using [Amazon Polly](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/) for speech-to-text (so the narrator is the British voice of "Brian")

The code...not the cleanest, as I was only a couple of years into learning R, but it's available [on Github](https://github.com/gilliganondata/holt_winters_demo_video).

It's an over-simplification of the Holt-Winters forecasting method, but it does a pretty solid job of explaining the basics of time-series composition (which had blown my mind earlier that year and, I will claim, continues to blow the minds of analysts the first time it's explained to them):
