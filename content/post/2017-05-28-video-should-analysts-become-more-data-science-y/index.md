The distinction between analytics and data science is either incredibly clear or incredibly murky. Or it's somewhere in between. I spent a hot minute 15 years into my career thinking I would become a data scientist...and quickly realized that there is too much calcification of the neurons in my brain for that to happen.

So..._then_ I spent a year or so exploring the idea of "being data science-y." Eventually, [Ian Thomas](https://twitter.com/ian_thomas) pointed out to me that maybe, rather than contorting the English language, I should just say that I was "an analyst who did some data science."

Still, I did the presentation below at [Superweek](https://superweek.hu) in January 2017, and the material has held up!
