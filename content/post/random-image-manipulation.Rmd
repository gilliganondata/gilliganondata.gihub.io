```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

We'll get to writing out the details later, but this is really about making a few different things work together to see what happens:

* Pulling an image from a SmugMug site at random (via the SmugMug API)
* Applying a random number of manipulations in a random order with random settings to that image
* Publishing the before and after as a new web page on this site
* Adding a link to that page to a master web page listing links to all of the times it's been run
* Tweeting the before/after in a single tweet and linking back to that web page
* Doing the above on a daily basis via Github actions
