At [Superweek](https://superweek.hu) in 2018, I drew a line from the world of Microsoft Excel to the world of statistics and machine learning: 

* Any time there are "dimensions and metrics" the data has been aggregated in some way
* Statisticians (and data scientists) generally think about data in terms of "observations"
* Introducing extra dimensionality _can_, in some ways, _de-aggregate_ data, which isn't ideal, but can be useful
* Dabbling with what's going on under the hood of a 1-way ANOVA (it's looking at both the difference between the means and the variance of the value around the means)
* "Uncertainty" is a _really_ important concept...that many marketers and analysts don't actually think with enough clarity about
