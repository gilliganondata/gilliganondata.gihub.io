Data visualization (and data storytelling) are _critical_ skills for the analyst to develop. I've lost count of how many times I've presented on the subject. This presentation at [Superweek](https://superweek.hu) in early 2020 (late January... _just_ before the world shut down due to COVID) wound up getting expanded to the point of being a [multi-hour online course through CXL](https://cxl.com/institute/online-course/data-presentation-and-visualization/) by that fall.

In this presentation, I stood on the shoulders of Stephen Few, Edward Tufte, Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic, and Lea Pica to explain what I think are some of the most critical concepts and techniques when it comes to data visualization (I did not get into data storytelling):

* The three types of memory: iconic (visual sensory register), short-term, and long term
* Miller's Law (7&#177;2 and short-term memory)
* What cognitive load is (including demonstrating it with several examples)
* Gestalt principles--not because they need to be overtly learned and applied, but as an illustration of how subtle changes to a visualization can drastically change how we perceive a visual
* My favorite data visualization tip: maximizing the data-pixel ratio (including applying the concept to both charts and tables)
* Why pie charts (and doughnut charts) are (generally speaking) evil--illustrated by assessing them through a cognitive load lens
* Why horizontal bar charts, conversely, are often pretty awesome
* A quick review of some non-standard data visualizations that can be very effective: slopegraphs, heatmap tables, scatterplots, and network diagrams
