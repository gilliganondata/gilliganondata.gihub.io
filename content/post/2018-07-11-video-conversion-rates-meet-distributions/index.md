My brain hurt for a while when I started thinking about where "confidence intervals" came into play when looking at the results of A/B tests that were comparing conversion rates between two experiences. Eventually, things clicked for me, so I put together a video explaining both where the confusion lay and then how we can work our way out of that confusion.

For giggles, I built the entire presentation with R using the [xaringan](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/xaringan.html) and [xkcd](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xkcd/index.html) packages so that the slides would be in the style of [xkcd.com](https://xkcd.com).
