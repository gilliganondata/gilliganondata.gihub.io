I am absolutely _not_ someone who prognosticates with any success. I don't even try, really, because I'm so bad at it. **My strongest case in point on this:** when Salesforce.com was founded, I thought it was an absolutely ridiculous idea that would never-never-never work out.

_So_, the 5-minute video below only appears prescient in hindsight, but I still go back and re-watch it periodically, and I occasionally point others to it as well.

The background is that there was a free 1-day conference that [Analytics Demystified](https://analyticsdemystified.com) ran for several years called ACCELERATE. The core presentation format was "10 Tips in 20 minutes." At the end of the conference, though, there were always a series of 5-minute presentations that were each intended to put forth a single big idea.

The first of those conferences was in San Francisco in November 2011, and I was one of those 5-minute presentations at the end of the day. I put a silly amount of time into my presentation. The "big idea" I put forth was pretty simple and quick. The prep time really went to articulating it tightly...in rhyme (which I memorized)...with appropriate visuals. What's striking to me is that:

* Clearly, there was already some industry hand-wringing about privacy (this was long before GDPR)
* It also really doubled down on an explict opt-in for tracking (with an easy opt out!)
* It references bitcoin (or "bitcoins")...which feels like a more recent thing, because...
* It also alludes to the fact that a smartphone is not a given
* It references data science (and this was long before I was in any way trying to wrap my head around what that really was)

It's a quick and fun little video. I actually was approached after presenting it by a gentleman who thought that I was actually pitching some startup (did I mention that this conference was in San Francisco)?
