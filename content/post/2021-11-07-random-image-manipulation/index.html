<p>We’ll get to writing out the details later, but this is really about making a few different things work together to see what happens:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pulling an image from a SmugMug site at random (via the SmugMug API)</li>
<li>Applying a random number of manipulations in a random order with random settings to that image</li>
<li>Publishing the before and after as a new web page on this site</li>
<li>Adding a link to that page to a master web page listing links to all of the times it’s been run</li>
<li>Tweeting the before/after in a single tweet and linking back to that web page</li>
<li>Doing the above on a daily basis via Github actions</li>
</ul>
<p>See a <a href="/image-randomize/">list of examples</a> that are currently available.</p>
