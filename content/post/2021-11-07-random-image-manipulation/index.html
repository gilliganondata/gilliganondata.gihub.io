<p>This is a process that runs daily and applies a <strong>random number of transformations</strong> in a <strong>random order</strong> with <strong>random settings</strong> to a <strong>randomly selected image</strong> from my <a href="https://twilson.smugmug.com/">SmugMug site</a>. You can see a <a href="/image-randomize/">list of the results</a> that are currently available. I started to try to do the math as to the number of possible outcomes and…it’s beyond me.</p>
<p>High-level, this is what happens:</p>

<div id="the-motivation" class="section level2">
<h2>The Motivation</h2>
<p>I don’t think this project qualifies as generative art (or generative “aRt,” specifically, but if you’re interested in that sort of thing, check out <a href="https://art.djnavarro.net/">Danielle Navarro’s amazing work</a> or <a href="https://clauswilke.com/art/">Claus O. Wilke’s work</a>—including his <a href="https://objkt.com/profile/clauswilke/created?search=&amp;sortBy=askAsc">NFTs</a>!—or <a href="https://koenderks.github.io/aRtsy/">Koen Derks’s aRtsy package that is specifically ggplot-oriented</a>).</p>
<p>Rather, it was an opportunity for me to combine a couple of my hobbies—<a href="https://twilson.smugmug.com/">nature photography</a> and R—into a single project and learn along the way! When it comes to doing programmatic (machine?) manipulation of photos, this is nothing nearly as involved as the neural networks employed by <a href="https://deepdreamgenerator.com/">Deep Dream Generator</a>, but, hey, this is me combined with Starry Night in an AI’s dream:</p>
<p><img src="images/tim_wilson_starry_night.jpeg" title="Tim Wilson Dreamt of with Starry Night" width="400" /></p>
<p>The learning that came along with the effort was:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cloud-based automation:</strong> I initially thought this would be Docker and the Google Cloud Platform, but, ultimately, it wound up just being GitHub Actions, which turned out to be cheaper and, arguably, simpler.</li>
<li><strong>Using APIs without a platform-specific package:</strong> I’ve known that <a href="https://httr.r-lib.org/"><code>httr</code></a> is the go-to package for working with REST APIs, but I had never used it directly from authentication through actual GETs.</li>
<li><strong>Image manipulation:</strong> Raster-based images are, at their core, just matrices with each pixel being represented by a value in the matrix. It turns out that it’s fun to think about exactly what the underlying matrix manipulation is that adds different effects to an image.</li>
<li><strong>Static site generation:</strong> This wound up being <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> along with <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> (with GitHub along the way).</li>
</ul>
<p>Somewhere in all of that, I got to work with <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets">GitHub Secrets</a> to securely store API tokens for SmugMug and Twitter!</p>
<p>Below, I’ve broken down the different components of the work, linking to specific resources for additional details. But, the full set of code really comes down to:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/gilliganondata/gilliganondata_site/tree/main/content/image-randomize">folder in the GitHub repository that serves this site</a> (<code>master.R</code> is really the key file; it sources all the other files)</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/gilliganondata/gilliganondata_site/blob/main/.github/workflows/daily-image-run.yaml">GitHub Action workflow YAML</a> that is also part of the repository that serves this site</li>
</ul>
<p>We can dig in a little deeper to explain the what’s what there.</p>

<h2>Pulling a Random Image from SmugMug</h2>
<p>As of this writing, there is not yet a package built specifically for connecting to SmugMug, so I worked through their pretty comprehensive <a href="https://api.smugmug.com/api/v2/doc">API documentation</a> and then used the <a href="https://httr.r-lib.org/"><code>httr</code></a> to actually query the API.</p>
<p>Although I was only pulling public images (from <a href="https://twilson.smugmug.com/">my personal SmugMug site</a>, using the API still requires creating and using an API token (specifically, a key and a secret). While doing the initial development, I simply put these in my <code>.Renviron</code> file as <code>SMUGMUG_KEY</code> and <code>SMUGMUG_SECRET</code> and then accessed them using <code>Sys.getenv()</code>. When I shifted to running the script via a GitHub Actions workflow, I simply created <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets">GitHub Secrets</a> with the exact same name. And…it worked! I was expecting that I was going to need to update the R script to actually access those values differently when they were set as GitHub Secrets, but, nope! As the workflow ran and established an environment, those values were there and were accessible with the exact same code.</p>
<p><em>Side note: Ultimately, the R script itself is something I can run locally and make <strong>no</strong> changes to when I check it in for use in the GitHub Actions workflow. The <strong>only</strong> “not needed for local but needed for the workflow run” is an <code>options()</code> setting for blogdown. This is one line in <code>master.R</code> and causes no harm whatsoever when running locally. Overall, I was pretty tickled that this is how things worked out.</em></p>
<p>What I wanted from SmugMug was pretty simple: a data frame that lists every image on my site.</p>
<p>What it took to do that was a two-step process:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Pull all of the <em>albums</em> on the site</li>
<li>Go through each album and pull each image in the album</li>
</ol>
<p>I accomplished this with a little bit of recursion. The code is pretty straightforward and contained in the <a href="https://github.com/gilliganondata/gilliganondata_site/blob/main/content/image-randomize/init_get_list_of_images.R">init_get_list_of_images.R</a> script.</p>
<p>The result was a data frame with one row for each image on the site. So, then it was just a matter of picking a row at random from that data frame using <code>sample()</code> and then tracking down the actual URL for that image and download and save it. I wound up capping the max width of the images to work with at 4,096 pixels just for file size and consistency reasons (since I record the exact transformations performed, it would be reasonably easy to recreate the same effect with a larger file if I wanted to).</p>
<p>This was actually a little messier than I expected, so it got its own script called <a href="https://github.com/gilliganondata/gilliganondata_site/blob/main/content/image-randomize/init_get_random_image.R">init_get_random_image.R</a> to perform that work.</p>
<p>Now it’s time to apply some transformations.</p>
</div>
<div id="creating-and-applying-a-random-set-of-transformations" class="section level2">
<h2>Creating and Applying a Random Set of Transformations</h2>
<p>I set this up to be reasonably extensible, in that it is modular with one script file for each possible transformation. Most of the transformations were ones available in Jeroen Ooms’s <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/vignettes/intro.html"><code>magick</code> package</a>, which is a wrapper for <a href="https://www.imagemagick.org/Magick++/STL.html">ImageMagick STL</a>. But, I also have a soft spot for Hiroyuki Tsuda’s <a href="https://htsuda.net/sketcher/"><code>sketcher</code> package</a>, as that was the first package I used to do any image manipulation, so I included <code>sketch</code> as one of the transformations, too.</p>
<p>The <em>possible</em> transformations that I’ve included so far are (each is in it’s own <code>.R</code> file):</p>
<ul>
<li>[magick] <a href="https://github.com/gilliganondata/gilliganondata_site/blob/main/content/image-randomize/mgk_image_modulate.R"><strong>Modulate</strong></a>—this adjusts the hue, saturation, and brightness of the image. The image starts with each of these three values as “100,” and then the script randomly selects values between 50 and 150 to apply to the transformation</li>
<li>[magick] <a href="https://github.com/gilliganondata/gilliganondata_site/blob/main/content/image-randomize/mgk_image_median.R"><strong>Median</strong></a>—this is an interesting one. The only input is a “radius” value, which I use a random value between 15 and 50. Then, for <em>each</em> pixel in the image, the transformation looks at <em>all</em> of the pixels within that radius of the pixel and changes that pixel’s color to be the median color of all of those pixels. This winds up <em>mostly</em> blurring the image…except not quite. If there is a very hard, high contrast edge, that tends to stick around (it’s median and not mean!). This is one of the more time-consuming transformations, which makes sense.</li>
<li>[magick] <a href="https://github.com/gilliganondata/gilliganondata_site/blob/main/content/image-randomize/mgk_image_colorize.R"><strong>Colorize</strong></a>—this takes a color (which I randomly set by choosing random R, G, and B values) and an opacity and overlays that on the image. It, essentially, tints the image with a random color and to a random degree.</li>
<li>[magick] <a href="https://github.com/gilliganondata/gilliganondata_site/blob/main/content/image-randomize/mgk_image_quantize.R"><strong>Quantize</strong></a>—this reduces the image to a limited number of total colors, which I’ve set to be somewhere between 4 and 16. In some cases, earlier transformations will have already converted the image to be grayscale and this has no actual effect. In other cases, it does!</li>
<li>[magick] <a href="https://github.com/gilliganondata/gilliganondata_site/blob/main/content/image-randomize/skc_sketch.R"><strong>Sketch</strong></a>—this is another somewhat process-intensive operation that makes a “sketch” of the image. The settings for it are the overall style (1 or 2), the lineweight (1 to 6), the contrast level (10 to 60), the amount of shadow (a real number between 0 and 1), and the gain (a real number between 0 and 1)</li>
</ul>
<p>The scripts for each of the above do a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select random values to be used for the settings</li>
<li>Apply the transformation to the current version of the image and then update that as the current version</li>
<li>Add to a string that records the specific settings that were used</li>
</ul>
<p>The question remains: what transformations are applied and in what order? This is simply a case where there is a tibble with the paths to each of these transformation scripts in the <code>master.R</code> script. The script:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Shuffles the order of the rows in the tibble.</li>
<li>Selects a random number between 1 and the number of rows in that tibble.</li>
<li>Pulls that number of rows from the tibble.</li>
<li>Runs the scripts (the paths) that were pulled.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think it’s actually reasonably elegant design-wise (if I do say so myself). All that is required for me to add another transformation is to create a new file for that transformation and add the path to that file to the original tibble.</p>
</div>
<div id="creating-a-web-page-with-the-beforeafter" class="section level2">
<h2>Creating a Web Page with the Before/After</h2>
<p>This is a pretty vanilla Hugo site, although it’s built and managed with blogdown, so the main references I used were the <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown site</a> and the <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo site</a>.</p>
<p>The main things that took me a while to figure out were:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I could just make a <a href="https://github.com/gilliganondata/gilliganondata_site/tree/main/content/image-randomize">dedicated folder under the ‘content’ folder</a> and put all of the scripts and details there. This is a sibling folder of the default <code>post</code> folder, which is where straight-up posts (like the one your reading now get built)</p></li>
<li><p>I could create an R script that would actually build the .Rmd file that would display the before and after images and the transformations applied. That script is <a href="https://github.com/gilliganondata/gilliganondata_site/blob/main/content/image-randomize/build_rmd.R">here</a>, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBIzgdUBDOk">this short video</a> from CradleToGraveR was really helpful in getting the details right on that.</p></li>
<li><p>When building that .Rmd file, I included a couple of handy things in the YAML header for when I built my list template (see the next item): a <code>type</code> parameter that simply populated with “image-randomization,” and then <code>img_original</code> and <code>img_transformed</code> parameter that contained the relative paths to the original and output images.</p></li>
<li><p>I had to read/watch the Hugo documentation on <a href="https://gohugo.io/templates/lists/">list templates</a> a few times to fully grok them, but this allowed me to make the <a href="https://gilliganondata.netlify.app/image-randomize/">page(s) of thumbnails</a> showing before and after images. The source for that is in the <a href="https://github.com/gilliganondata/gilliganondata_site/blob/main/layouts/image-randomize/image-randomize.html.html"><code>/layouts/image-randomize</code></a> folder, and the path and the filename for that are key. There is logic in that template that says to “just use the files that are of”type" (from the YAML header) of “image-randomization” and then use the <code>img_original</code> and <code>img_transformed</code> values to actually create the thumbnails. This…is pretty cool! (There is some inefficiency with the images themselves, as it currently just changes the dimensions of the images, but is loading the full images, so the page weight is heavier than it needs to be; that’s a fix for another day)</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="tweeting-the-result" class="section level2">
<h2>Tweeting the Result</h2>
<p>The wrinkle with tweeting the result is that the tweet shouldn’t occur until <em>after</em> the web page with the results are published. That means the repo has to be committed and pushed back into GitHub (via GitHub Actions) so that Netlify is triggered to actually rebuild and publish the updated site. This happens pretty quickly—a few seconds for the GitHub commit and push, and then less than 30 seconds for Netlify to republish the site.</p>
<p>I <em>could</em> simply have a process whereby a daily tweet has a broken link for less than a minute. While I’ve certainly cut a few corners here and there on this effort, that’s a small bridge too far.</p>
<p>So, instead:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A couple of lines of code at the very end of the <a href="https://github.com/gilliganondata/gilliganondata_site/blob/main/content/image-randomize/build_rmd.R">script that builds the <code>.Rmd</code> file for the web page</a> create a list with three items: the ultimate URL for the new page, the path to the original image, and the path to the transformed image. The script then writes that to a file using <code>saveRDS</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://github.com/gilliganondata/gilliganondata_site/blob/main/.github/workflows/daily-image-run.yaml">GitHub Action workflow YAML</a> sleeps for 5 minutes (which I may shorten), loads up the various keys and secrets (stored as GitHub secrets in the repo) needed to access the Twitter API, and then calls a script that reads the RDS file and tweets the result.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The inaugural tweet of this process is <a href="https://twitter.com/tgwilson/status/1468179886133022720">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="automating-all-of-this" class="section level2">
<h2>Automating All of This</h2>
<p>The automation, as already noted, used GitHub Actions. This turned out to be a little bit easier than I expected, but it still took quite a bit of trial and error and Googling. The end result is simply having a <a href="https://github.com/gilliganondata/gilliganondata_site/blob/main/.github/workflows/daily-image-run.yaml">YAML file</a> posted in a <code>.github/workflows</code> folder of the repository used to build this website.</p>
<p>My primary source for figuring out how to get this working was a <a href="https://blog--simonpcouch.netlify.app/blog/r-github-actions-commit/">detailed post by Simon Couch</a>. The main way I wound up diverging from Simon’s post is that, ultimately, I did <em>not</em> make the script into a package. I actually initially did…sort of…and it worked, but it wound up being unnecessarily clunky.</p>
<p>I suspect that, in many cases, the package route is the way to go. But, in my case, I was trying to run the script in a repo that actually generates and publishes content to a website (this website). It felt…weird…to try to nest a package inside that repo. I gave it a shot, but, ultimately, realized that I was really only using the <code>DESCRIPTION</code> file to get the requisite packages installed. That’s it. I didn’t seem to be getting any other benefit out of packagifying the work. And I’d introduced filename restrictions and a slightly messy file hierarchy in the process!</p>
<p>Additional digging turned up a <a href="https://drmowinckels.io/blog/2021-03-23-using-github-actions-to-build-your-hugo-website/">helpful post by Athanasia Monika Mowinckel</a> that included details on how to install packages directly within the GitHub Actions workflow.</p>
<p>I still ran into a few wrinkles with, for instance, <code>libcurl</code>-dependent packages (including <code>httr</code>!) not installing until I had manually installed <code>libcurl</code> first (within the workflow). I had the same issue with <code>libmagick</code>. So, that section of the YAML looked like the following. Ultimately, the <code>install.packages()</code> was really the only reason, I think, for setting the script up as a package…and that seemed like overkill (admitting that I have no control over the <em>version</em> of each package being installed withe the approach below; we’ll assume backward compatibility of future CRAN versions).</p>
<pre><code>      - name: Install libcurl (for curl/httr)
        run: |
          sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev -y

      - name: Install libmagick (for the magick package)
        run: |
          sudo apt-get install libmagick++-dev

      - name: Install R packages
        run: |
          install.packages(c(&quot;dplyr&quot;, &quot;purrr&quot;, &quot;httr&quot;, &quot;knitr&quot;, &quot;jpeg&quot;, &quot;magick&quot;, &quot;sketcher&quot;, &quot;scales&quot;, &quot;blogdown&quot;), Ncpus = 2)
        shell: Rscript {0}</code></pre>
<p>My debugging process for the workflow was to change the cron schedule to be <code>0 * * * *</code>, which had it run hourly. It would takes ~20 minutes to run if it doesn’t error out, so that then gave me a solid 20-30 minutes to debug (the workflow logs on GitHub were <em>super</em> helpful there—very easy to track down exactly where in the workflow the error occurred and what the error was, which was then generally readily Google-able), tweak/debug and commit and push updates.</p>
<p>The “20 minutes to run” initially surprised me, as the script itself runs in 1-3 minutes locally (depending on the transformations being applied). But, I then realized it makes sense: each time the job runs, it’s <em>installing R</em> and then <em>installing the requisite packages</em> (this is why I’m installing and loading simply <strong>dplyr</strong> and <strong>purrr</strong> rather than <strong>tidyverse</strong>), and then actually running the script. I suspect this is one of those things that would be more efficient if I was actually doing this through Google Cloud Platform with a containerized image. But that’s an exploration for another day.</p>
<p>There are definitely still some aspects of the YAML that I don’t fully understand. I tried to selectively remove things that I didn’t think were necessary for my purposes, but the overall syntax is still a bit beyond me.</p>
